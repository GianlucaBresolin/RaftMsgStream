## Documentation
[Technical Report](https://github.com/GianlucaBresolin/RaftMsgStream/blob/main/TechnicalReport.pdf), elaborated for the exam of the course "Runtimes for distribution and concurrency", attended at the University of Padua. Here you can find the design choices that led to the implementation of the project, with considerations on scalability, on the runtime of Go and on the Raft algorithm. 
In addition, an integration [Integrazione Scritta](https://github.com/GianlucaBresolin/RaftMsgStream/blob/main/IntegrazioneScritta.pdf) (written in Italian) provides some further details about interesting aspects of the algorithm and the runtime of Go.
